# ICPI Style Guide

## Overivew
Over the last year, PEPFAR has been setting targets and entering into DATIM since early last year. With a wealth of HIV/AIDS programmatic results down to the site level quarterly, DATIM is an extremely useful resource to support data-driven decision making and help build capacity necessary towards achieving epidemic control.   DATIM has features, such as its built in pivot table and visualization that helps get a view of the data. This view, however, is just a peak into the data and can be rather limiting.

Agencies, TWGs, and ICPI workstreams need to get more than a glimpse at this data; they need to use this information to evaluate progress and make strategic decisions. As a result, we are seeing an influx in “tools” and “dashboards” to make sense of complex and ample data across numerous operating units and indicators. This is a great step towards data-driven decision making. One drawback is the lack of coordination and, as a result, a lack of uniformity in the creation of these tools. 

An optimal solution would be to coordinate efforts, designing visual tools and dashboards in a similar fashion. Adopting a uniform structure and overall style has a number of benefits including a similar SQL pull for each product to get large scale data out of DATIM and improved collaboration across ICPI analysts.  

Given the widespread use of Excel given accessibility and skillsets, this document outlines style and structure guidance for developing dashboards and tools in Excel.
